# firefox-theme
 A firefox theme

This theme uses colors from: 
[design-tokens](https://github.com/FirefoxUX/design-tokens)


This theme is basically a fork of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/7wt6gt/safarifirefox_hybrid_dark_style/) theme, i have permission of the original author to continue this theme.


## How to use this:

I recommend to take a look on [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/73dvty/tutorial_how_to_create_and_livedebug_userchromecss/) on how to use css themes for firefox.

For tabs i'd recommend an addon like [Tab Center Reborn](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabcenter-reborn/)

If you have trouble with the colors you can install [Firefox Color](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-color/) and manually import the colors in the `Custom colors tab`, you can find the colors inside the `colors` folder.
